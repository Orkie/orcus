Orcus:
	* LCD functions - blitter, yuv
	* SD card - write support
	* F200 touchscreen
	* Set CPU clock
	* MMU and PU functions
	* Interrupts - could be handy for timer, also for audio buffers running low? what about DMA transfers finishing?
	
remove orcus_delay entirely

Order to work on:
* 2d accelerator
* SD write (fairly simple)
* Set CPU clock (hopefully simple)
* Interrupts:
   > Need a way of setting the master swi/irq/fiq functions, as well as exception handlers
   > Provide a default IRQ and FIQ implementation where user can register a callback for a specific type of interrupt
   > Configure whether something is an IRQ or FIQ interrupt
   > Function for triggering SWI - EABI calls SWI 0 with the number in R7 due to caching
   > Would like the ability to interrupt on...
      - v/hsync
      - DMA transfer complete
      - timer
      - buttons
      - 2d accelerator finished
      - the 920/940 interchange registers
* I2C (looks very simple to implement so a quick win before getting into something involved)
* MMU / PU
* Touchscreen
